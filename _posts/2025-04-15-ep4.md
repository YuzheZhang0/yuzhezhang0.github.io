Good day hackers! Today we continue on learning about all the different Nmap scan types, and their niche uses!
## (2/16) `ACK` Scan - Sadly outdated :(

**Disclaimer:** This technique is outdated. The assumption of this scanning technique is that `RFC 793` is honored. But `RFC 793` has been declared `obsolete` since August 2022. 

Modern firewalls would most likely drop the returning `RST` packet when receiving unsolicited `ACK` packets. This is to avoid giving any information to potential threat actors. 

If you're still interested, read on!

When the `ACK` Scan type is selected by the `-sA` flag, Nmap sends an `ACK` packet to target ports.

As mentioned in [my previous blog](https://yuzhezhang0.github.io/posts/2025/04/active-scanning-part-1/), the TCP 3-way handshake starts with a `SYN` packet.

So when open ports receive an `ACK` packet first, they would be like "Huh? This is not how a handshake starts.", and then proceeds to send `RST` packet to terminate connection.

Closed ports will also send `RST`. They're just like that. `RST` to everything.

**So....an `ACK` scan *cannot* differentiate between an open and closed ports. They will both be marked as `unfiltered`**

Then why do we even use this scan?

Let's think about the ports that won't return an `RST` packet for a second.

If the target port does not respond, or returns ICMP errors, that means the target port is *unreachable*. In other words, they might be *filtered by a firewall*.

**That is exactly the idea behind an `ACK` Scan. To map out firewall rules.**

## (3/16) `Window` Scan - Sadly outdated :(

This one is a variation based on the `ACK` Scan, so unfortunately it's also outdated.

![TCP Header Format](/images/TCP-Header-Format.png)

Wow! First picture in a blog. We've entered a new age.

Anyways, this picture shows how TCP headers are structured. You can see all the flag bits that we've been talking about, like `SYN`, `ACK`,`RST`, etc. 

Next to the flag bits, there is a section called `Window Size`.

According to Nmap wiki, when some systems receive an unsolicited `ACK` packet, they will send a `RST` packet, but the `Window Size` value would be different, based on whether the port is `open` or `closed`.

So a `Window` Scan is just like an `ACK` scan, except that it can sometimes tell whether the port is `open` or `closed`.

I'd love to experiment with one of these systems that return different `Window` values. 

## (4-7/16) `FIN` Scan,`NULL` Scan, Xmas Scan, Maimon Scan

These scan types are similarly outdated due to `RFC 793` being obsolete. 

It was still fun reading about them in the Nmap wiki.

Felt like a history lesson. 

I encourage anyone interested to give it a read [here](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html)

## Up Next

Tomorrow we will look at more scan types in Nmap that is more relevant to today's world!

We're going to start digging into the UDP protocol, and potentially the SCTP protocol.

See you hackers tomorrow!
