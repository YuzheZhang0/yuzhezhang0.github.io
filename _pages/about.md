My name is Yuzhe Zhang. I'm a penetration tester. I started this blog in April 2025 to document my learning progress every day.

At this point in my career, I have done 3+ years of pentest consulting work, with a main focus on web applications, APIs, internal/external network, and mobile applications.

I am irresistably drawn to **red/purple team, enterprise security, and adversarial emulation**. So my blogs will be mostly focused on my progression towards that career path. I may also document my struggles in bug bounty, but in a more realistic way than `Today I found xyz bug and got paid $5k! Just learn this one trick and you can do it too!`

I will, hopefully, document here everything that I learn, how much time it took, and set up realistic lab environment for others to practice different topics/techniques.

Please join me in my journey!
==========

If you came across my blogs, and would like to join me in this journey to become a seasoned red teamer, please reach out to me on LinkedIn. I will try to get a discord server started in the future. I will also happily accept constructive criticism, and suggestion of topics I should explore, and tools I should build. I want to make friends along the way, and grow with you.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.
